                    The following is an secret technique used by the ancient Greeks during the festival 
                    known as "Hotdoggius". Despite the obvious Latin origins of that name, the festival 
                    was definitely super ancient Greek. No doubt about it. Anyway, the technique was passed 
                    down to me from my great Greek Uncle Hoddigi (trust me, also very Greek name).

                    You'll only need a few simple ingredients to get this thing going, most of which you can 
                    find at your local grocery store or battlefield:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The blood of your enemies</li>
                        <li>Hotdogs (the thicker the better)</li>
                        <li>Water (the thicker the better)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                    So, the recipe essentially "boils" down to three steps:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Pour the blood of your enemies in a ceremonial vessel</li>
                        <li>Heat up some water in a pot</li>
                        <li>Toss some dogs in the boiling water</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
